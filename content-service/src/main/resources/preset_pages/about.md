##  The site
Nostalogic began as a technical experiment. Its purpose is to replicate various features found on other sites in an efficient, streamlined, modern web application. Current features include:

- User registration and login
- User groups
- Access management for users and user groups
- An article display system

This is a side project developed in free time so further development may be slow, but other planned features include:

- A full content management system
- A comment system for logged in users
- A file upload system

## The technical details
At the core of Nostalogic is `nostalogic.io` - a REST API distributed across several microservices. The original core services are written in Kotlin and use the Spring framework. The frontend you''re looking at, `nostalogic.net`, is built in Angular.

## The creator
This site''s creator, known here as Eljee, is a software engineer with several years of experience working on web applications.
After working on existing projects, some built with out-dated technology like ColdFusion, Eljee decided to create Nostalogic
as an attempt to replicate some of the most interesting or useful features seen in web applications with the
most modern technology available, built entirely from scratch.
