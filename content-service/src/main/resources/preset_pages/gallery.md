A selection of images created during the development of Nostalogic.
### Banner Images
##### Origin
These banner images were created fairly late during the design process, hence why they include the name logo seen on the released version.

I had much more experience fiddling around in image editors to create things like this than in designing websites so my first instinct was to design a banner to be displayed at the top of the page as the focus and then let things flow from there. Over time I moved away from this idea since I felt it would detract from the site's content, so the layout switched to intersecting navigation bars bordering the content taking up most of the page.

###### Blue Skies

An abstract blue themed banner, made with various "abstract" brush sets blended together.

###### Deus Expy

A dark orange design heavily inspired by the game *Deus Ex: Human Revolution* - look up any of that game's art and you should see a dark murky background intersected with a few bright light sources and an overall dark orange colour scheme.

###### Nether Tiles

This is the main deviation in this set from being dominated by smooth lines. Underneath it's still essentially a smooth abstract design similar to *Blue Skies*, but with a mosaic pattern applied on top. In fact I think the base image here is the same one used in *Blue Skies*, but with a second set of brushes on top and a green filter applied over it all. I couldn't decide if I wanted the green to completely dominate the image or not so I made a variation:

###### Nether Tiles 2

Here the green filter isn't applied so you can more clearly see that there's a separate green abstract design on top of a blue one, blended together so the green only shows in the dark areas.

###### Green Arcane

Since all the other designs were purely abstract this was an attempt to add some variation with solid, distinct objects. Originally actual text was used, I think I tried both code samples and meaningless "lorem ipsum" text, but both drew too much attention from what's meant to be a pretty looking image marked with the site name. In the end some brushes with meaningless "arcane" symbols were used in multiple layers at different sizes.

###### Red Electric

This began with just the lightning effect from some brushes over a plain background. When it came to adding further details I tried a few things but ultimately thought the lightning effect could almost carry the entire image, so a faint cloud layer was added behind it to support some colour shade variation and it was left at that.

###### Big Blue

The other banners were deliberately created the same size with the same name logo in the bottom left, with the intent that they could be a set with one randomly displayed each time the page was loaded. This completely plain abstract image was from about a year earlier before that idea came about.


### The Early Version
##### Origin
Long before deciding to build a whole web application from scratch, `nostalogic.net` existed as a host for a PHPBB forum I was using as a personal website, with a basic splash page linking to that forum (at a subdirectory). When I first thought about expanding the splash page to something with more function I initially tried using PHP since it was a language I had never used but knew it was very common in web design. This screenshot of a work in progress PHP login system is as far as that version went:

I had already begun using Angular for other projects around this time (the early version, what's now known as AngularJS) and found it a lot more appealing than this PHP experiment. Both the language and this top to bottom interface design were abandoned here.
