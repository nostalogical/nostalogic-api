### 2020-12-30
##### Key features

##### Description
This is the go live of Nostalogic getting both the API and web client in a position to be properly released. This is expected to be flawed but usable, many features the backend is capable of aren't fully implemented yet in order to bring the site live without further delay. Most significantly the backend can only do basic content retrieval based on some path, e.g. `about/changelog`, and the ability to edit or create this content isn't in place in either the frontend or backend yet.
